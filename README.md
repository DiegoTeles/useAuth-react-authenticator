## Description

_This project was created to solve an auth problem with the react-router-dom v6 library where I created a custom hook responsible for the authentication layer of the application._

## Development setup

This project was developed using React and react-router-dom v6

## What I used

- [React - Hooks](https://reactjs.org/) for the frontend
  - [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) as boilerplate
  - [react-router-dom](https://reactrouter.com/en/main) as router
